# StocObs

STOCOBS is a custom skill for Amazon Alexa. It uses Quandl's Wiki End Of Day (EOD) Stock Prices API to get stock prices of a company.
The user interacts with the skill by saying something like "Alexa ask stock aubs how was Amazon today".
STOCOBS will fetch the opening, high, low, and closing stock prices of the company.

> Note: Pronounce STOCOBS as "stock aubs".
